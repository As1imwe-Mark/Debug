  ## summation of all odd fibonacci numbers
  This function takes in a number as an argument and returns its finobacci numbers, gets the odd finobacci numbers and returns their sum
  for example
  fibonacci(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.
